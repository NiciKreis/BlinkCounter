# Blink Counter
iOS app for iPad to count the number of blinks per minute. 
(Graphical user interface could be warped on the iPhone)

 ## Run
 1. Open App
 2. Start timer with "Start" (There is a bug that causes the start button to have to be pressed twice the first time)

## Read out CSV
All 52 Blendshapes are logged every second in a csv. 
To read out the csv manually, go to settings and change "Document Storage" from "iCloud drive" to "On My iPad". Now, the csv file can be found in "Files - On my iPad - BlinkCounter".
